            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, specializing in biomechanics with a focus on how footwear technology and biomechanical interventions influence athletic performance, injury risk, and rehabilitation outcomes. My research combines principles of biomechanics, data science, and sports performance to explore sex-specific differences in movement mechanics and to develop more personalized strategies for enhancing athletic performance and minimizing injury-related pain.</p>
            <p>I hold a Master’s degree in Biomechanics, where I investigated the biomechanical and physiological impacts of advanced footwear technologies (commonly referred to as “super shoes”) on distance runners. My work has been presented at major biomechanics conferences, and I continue to develop expertise in both experimental biomechanics techniques and advanced statistical analyses to better understand how interventions like footwear can influence running mechanics.</p>
            <p>In addition to my research, I have extensive experience in mentoring and collaborating with student researchers, and I actively contribute to the biomechanics community. I am passionate about applying my work in both academic and applied settings to improve clinical outcomes and enhance sports performance.</p>
