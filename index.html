        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Justin Matties, a biomechanics researcher and PhD student at UMass Amherst. My work focuses on understanding the biomechanics of running, exploring sex-specific responses to advanced footwear, injury interventions, and personalized equipment design.
        </p>
        <p>
            With expertise in biomechanics, data science, and computational statistics, I integrate advanced tools to analyze gait mechanics and their effects on performance, pain reduction, and clinical outcomes.
