            <h2>Master's Research</h2>
            <p>
                My master's research focused on investigating the biomechanical and physiological effects of advanced footwear technology, specifically carbon-plated running shoes ("super shoes"). This study looked into how different types of footwear affect running performance, energy expenditure, and injury prevention strategies.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Exploring the energetic cost differences between super shoes and traditional footwear</li>
                <li>Impact on running economy and gait biomechanics</li>
                <li>Sex-specific responses to advanced footwear technology</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Current Projects</h2>
            <p>
                My ongoing research continues to investigate individual biomechanical responses to different footwear and interventions, with a focus on injury prevention and optimizing athletic performance.
